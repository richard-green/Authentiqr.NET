Run the program and a little padlock icon appears in the system tray.

You can add accounts by either entering the code displayed in the website, or you can drag/drop a QR-code image onto the Add Account dialog box

Every 30 seconds a new code will be generated, which you can get simply by going to the context menu and clicking on the numbers. This will copy the value into your clipboard.

Have fun!
